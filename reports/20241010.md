# Contributions of Individual Team Members

## Goals from Last Week
This is the first week; therefore, no goals from last week.

## Progress and Issues

### Afuza (UI / Frontend / Backend)
- Progress
    - Initialized github organization for team members and project repository.
    - Add README.md in root directory with project information and project setup instructions for developers.
    - Established initial project structure with React Native, Linting, Nativewind, and Firebase SDK.
    - Drew rough mockups for initial UI to get feedback from team members.
    - Learned basics of React Native and Firebase SDK integration with React Native.
- Issues
    - When first initializing the repository, React Native had an update which broke the start command to create the project which made me unable to install certain dependencies. This took me several hours before finding out that it was not on my end but rather React Native's. The solution was to specify a previous version of React Native before installing dependencies.

### Steven (UI / Frontend)
- Progress
    - Learned how to use Figma and started drawing mockups for the UI
    - Started learning React Native by looking at documentation and examples of components
- Issues
    - Figma is definitely not easy to use and not beginner friendly so just figuring out how to do basic tasks was very time consuming
