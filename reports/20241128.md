## Progress and Issues

### Afuza (UI / Frontend / Backend / QA)
- Progress
    - Overhauled the exercise screen display to match the functionality and look of the original intended design. This allows user to have a larger selection of exercises with different metrics (such as distance traveled and time taken) and greater user experience.
    - When creating the forms for inputting exercise metrics (weights, distance, etc), I learned that I could dynamically create states in React within a map which persists the state.
- Issues
    - Thankfully did not have any trouble in particular this week and everything went smoothly.

### Steven (UI / Frontend)
- Progress
    - Tried installing a great deal of dependencies based on error messages from tests
    - Experimented with mocking to resolve dependency issues
    - Certain text elements were able to be detected by the tests
    - Integration testing was a lot more complex than I anticipated, anything outside of the most basic "check if this text is on screen" didn't work
- Issues
    - I'm currently stuck on how to check dynamic text elements and properties with greater depth, such as modals
    - It seemed like I needed to install a bunch of packages and update existing ones based on my errors, but that wasn't actually the case and I was approaching the tests the wrong way.

### Dominic (Frontend / Backend / QA)
- Progress
    - made backend for workouts tab and workout history
    - developed schema as discussed, and put into base user and firebase
- Issues
