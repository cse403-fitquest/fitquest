## Progress and Issues

### Afuza (UI / Frontend / Backend / QA)
- Progress
    - What you did
    - What worked
    - What you learened
- Issues
    - Where you had trouble
    - Where you are stuck

### Steven (UI / Frontend)
- Progress
    - Tried installing a great deal of dependencies based on error messages from tests
    - Experimented with mocking to resolve dependency issues
    - Certain text elements were able to be detected by the tests
    - Integration testing was a lot more complex than I anticipated, anything outside of the most basic "check if this text is on screen" didn't work
- Issues
    - I'm currently stuck on how to check dynamic text elements and properties with greater depth, such as modals
    - It seemed like I needed to install a bunch of packages and update existing ones based on my errors, but that wasn't actually the case and I was approaching the tests the wrong way.
