## Progress and Issues

### Afuza (UI / Frontend / Backend / QA)

    - Fix issue with Colors.ts imports because filename changes weren't tracked in Git

### Steven (UI / Frontend)
- Progress
    - Experimented with loading png files within the app
    - Ultimately successful after a lot of experimentation with file pathing and different implementations
- Issues
    - I made a pretty big mistake during this process because the screen that I was looking at was actually not the one that the code I wrote was affecting, so a lot of trial and error was wasted. After I figured that out, I was able to fix the problem relatively quickly.
