## Progress and Issues

### Afuza (UI / Frontend / Backend / QA)
- Progress
    - Finish final version of UI design on FIgma
        - Includes user flow for each screen
        - Includes error handling in sign in / sign out flow
        - Includes color scheme and confirmation modals
        - Shared the UI with 10+ test users to gather feedback on the designs. All users were satisfied with the design.
- Issues
    - I was vaguely familiar with designs on Figma, however I was quick to realize that I made many mistakes regarding making designs in Figma which could have saved me a few hours of time. Things like creating components in the designs by which I only need to change one copy of it in order to change all available copies (used in tab bars, modals, and screen background and containers)
