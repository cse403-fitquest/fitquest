    - Setup initial testing and CI
        - Setup initial unit tests for reusable frontend components
        - Setup CI workflow for the above unit tests
    - I was really happy to get to learn about how to implement continuous integration for tests, I will still need to learn  more about implementing integration tests in React Native with Expo, but that is something we need for this project.
- Issues
    - I was vaguely familiar with designs on Figma, however I was quick to realize that I made many mistakes regarding making designs in Figma which could have saved me a few hours of time. Things like creating components in the designs by which I only need to change one copy of it in order to change all available copies (used in tab bars, modals, and screen background and containers)

### Steven (UI / Frontend)

    - started learning and using React Native Expo
    - Added additional views to welcome the user and for the onboarding wizard

        - Includes basic radio button menu proof of concept for onboarding wizard
- Issues
    - I had some confusion while learning React Native Expo because I had looked up guides for React Native, which is a bit different. Once I realized the difference, I was able to find the right tutorials to get started.
    - Right now I'm not sure how the onboarding wizard's menus will save information, both in the app and on the backend server.
