## Progress and Issues

### Afuza (UI / Frontend / Backend / QA)
- Progress
    - What you did
    - What worked
    - What you learened
- Issues
    - Where you had trouble
    - Where you are stuck

### Steven (UI / Frontend)
- Progress
    - Testing PRs has revealed a few major bugs that we were able to address before they got out of hand
    - Balance testing was needed for combat, since enemies were too powerful, and I made and tested some adjustments to their scaling
    - Manual testing was not ideal, but considering the amount of time remaining, and the difficulty of writing integration tests, it was for the best
    - Manual testing revealed a lot of problems that weren't directly tied to features added or altered by a particular PR, which meant that I had to make decisions about what I should and shouldn't test, and in the end I decided that systematically testing everything on any affected page was a reasonable balance
    - This was a case where accumulating some technical debt was apropriate since the deadline was coming up really fast
- Issues
    - Integration testing remains extremely difficult to troubleshoot due to the ambiguity of errors, which makes thorough testing of the app time-consuming
