## Progress and Issues

### Afuza (UI / Frontend / Backend / QA)
- Progress
    - I worked on finishing up implementations of the workout module, which now looks much more user friendly and accessible to anyone. Based on previous feedback, this meant a better UI for workout templates and more exercise selection to cater to a wider variety of individuals.
    - I learned about how to build and deploy (albeit not to the app store) android apps in the form of APKs via expo.
    - When trying to integrate and finish the social screen (displaying friend information), I realized that the previous backend design was faulty in that I stored static user information in the database to be immediately displayed to the frontend. This was bad because this meant that the user data could be stale. I had to refactor this to only save user IDs which would later then be fetched (with updated information) at the time the user opens or refreshes the app. This was a reminder to me that data that could potentially be changed should be stored in the form of unchangeable IDs.
- Issues
    - Initially planned to add background music to the app, which worked during implementation if not for the fact that the music did not loop (despite the documentation for the library used) and having to manage asynchronously loading and unloading the music provided another layer of complexity which was not worth it.
    - Since the fight screen is overhauled to use interval timers, I was stuck when trying to do integration testing for it for a while. I later found out that there are certain functions in the React Native Testing Library I can use to handle mocking asynchronous actions.

### Steven (UI / Frontend)
- Progress
    - Testing PRs has revealed a few major bugs that we were able to address before they got out of hand
    - Balance testing was needed for combat, since enemies were too powerful, and I made and tested some adjustments to their scaling
    - Manual testing was not ideal, but considering the amount of time remaining, and the difficulty of writing integration tests, it was for the best
    - Manual testing revealed a lot of problems that weren't directly tied to features added or altered by a particular PR, which meant that I had to make decisions about what I should and shouldn't test, and in the end I decided that systematically testing everything on any affected page was a reasonable balance
    - This was a case where accumulating some technical debt was apropriate since the deadline was coming up really fast
- Issues
    - Integration testing remains extremely difficult to troubleshoot due to the ambiguity of errors, which makes thorough testing of the app time-consuming

### Dominic (Frontend / Backend / QA)
- Progress
    - made integration tests for shop and profile 
    - checked dependencies and removed certain dependencies in profile 
    - finished the test suite for shop and profile 
    - helped with exercises test suite
- Issues
    - oh gosh integration testing was so challenging
    - it requires in depth knowledge of all dependencies 
    - so many issues that i thought was with the code, or the test suite and was actually vice versa
