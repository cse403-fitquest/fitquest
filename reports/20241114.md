## Progress and Issues

### Afuza (UI / Frontend / Backend / QA)
- Progress
    - Created aribitrary user threshold for exp such that users will "level up" after reaching the threshod. Levelling up simply means that a user gains an attribute point that they can allocate to any one of the three available attributes.
    - Created modals for gaining exp after a workout and another modal for leveling up after finishing a workout.
    - Created screen in profile screen that allows users to allocate any attribute point(s) they might have to their base attributes.
    - Normalized item modal displays between profile screen and shop screen
- Issues
    - Could not get as much done this week due to studying for the exam
