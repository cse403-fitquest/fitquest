## üìã Setup

Before you start, you will need to have the following tools installed on your PC/Laptop:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Project installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cse403-fitquest/fitquest
   cd fitquest
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```

4. Setup device for development.

   For now, the easiest and recommended way to view the app is to use your physical device through expo. On the Play Store (Android) or App Store (iOS), download Expo Go. When the app is running after completing step 3, scan the QR code given in the terminal in the Expo Go application.

   But if you want to work with an emulator (android/ios) instead, follow instructions in this site: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=android&device=simulated

### Configure linting

1. Install the ESLint extention on VSCode.

2. Reload VSCode to see changes.

3. For ease of use, make sure to turn enable format-on-save on VSCode settings.

### Firebase Setup

1. Access firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)

2. Create a new project

3. Within the project, register a new **web** app

4. Copy the configuration parameters provided by firebase and set it in [firebaseConfig.ts](./firebaseConfig.ts). Example below

   ```typescript
   const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "yourAPIKey",
      authDomain: "fitquest-xxxxx.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "fitquest-xxxxx",
      storageBucket: "fitquest-xxxxx.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
      appId: "X:XXXXXXXXXXXX:web:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
      measurementId: "X-XXXXXXXXXX"
   };
   ```

5. Start (or restart if already running) the server

   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```
