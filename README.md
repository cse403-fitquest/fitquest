## ‚ú® Features

- **Character Progression**

  Level up your characters and embark on quests

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you start, you will need to have the following tools installed on your PC/Laptop:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cse403-fitquest/fitquest
   cd fitquest
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```

4. Setup device for development.

   For now, the easiest and recommended way to view the app is to use your physical device through expo. On the Play Store (Android) or App Store (iOS), download Expo Go. When the app is running after completing step 3, scan the QR code given in the terminal in the Expo Go application.

   But if you want to work with an emulator (android/ios) instead, follow instructions in this site: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=android&device=simulated

Configure linting

1. Install the ESLint extention on VSCode if you haven't.

2. Reload VSCode to see changes.

3. For ease of use, make sure to turn enable format-on-save on VSCode settings.
