## ‚ú® Features

- **Quest-Motivated Workouts**

   Users complete workouts by logging physical activities to gain progression on quests they embarked on.

- **Character Progression System**

   Users earn experience points to level up their character which gives them attribute points to spend on customizing how their character grows.

- **Dynamic Turn-Based Combat**

   As users progress through quests, they will have the opportunity to fight against monsters and bosses in a dynamic turn-based combat encounter.

- **Virtual Rewards**

   As users defeat monsters, they earn gold which can be used to purchase cooler and stronger items.

- **Social Connection**

  Connect with friends, see when they last did a workout and what quest they have embarked on this week.


## üìã Setup

Before you start, you will need to have the following tools installed on your PC/Laptop:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Project installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cse403-fitquest/fitquest
   cd fitquest
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```

4. Setup device for development.

   With an android device, the fastest way to use the app is to use your physical device through expo. On the Play Store, download Expo Go. When the app is running after completing step 3, scan the QR code given in the terminal in the Expo Go application.

   With an iOS device, you will need to work with an android emulator. Following the below instructions will take around 15 minutes to setup depending on whether you have installed android studio: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=android&device=simulated&mode=expo-go

### Firebase Setup

Do this setup to use your own set of data that the app can interface with.

1. Access firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)

2. Create a new project

3. Within the project, register a new **web** app

4. Copy the configuration parameters provided by firebase and set it in [firebaseConfig.ts](./firebaseConfig.ts). Example below

   ```typescript
   const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "yourAPIKey",
      authDomain: "fitquest-xxxxx.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "fitquest-xxxxx",
      storageBucket: "fitquest-xxxxx.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
      appId: "X:XXXXXXXXXXXX:web:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
      measurementId: "X-XXXXXXXXXX"
   };
   ```

5. You will need to create a "quests", "items", "users", and "friends" collection in firestore.

      a. For the quests collection, you will need to fill in dummy data in the form:

         // TODO: PLACEHOLDER FOR QUEST DOCUMENT IN FIRESTORE

   b. For items collection, you will need to fill in data for items for users to purchase in the form:

      ```typescript
      {
         id: "t1_dagger",
         name: "T1 Dagger",
         type: "WEAPON"
         description: "Small but mighty! Perfect for poking holes in your enemies' plans."
         spriteID: "t1_dagger"
         power: 5,
         speed: 10,
         health: 0,
         cost: 50,
         createdAt: November 9, 2024 at 6:37:29‚ÄØPM UTC-8
      }
      ```

   c. Users collection can be left empty, as new documents will be created as new users registers an account.

   d. Friends collection can also be left empty, as new documents and relations will be made as users add friends.

5. Start (or restart if already running) the server

   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```

### Configure linting

1. Install the ESLint extention on VSCode.

2. Reload VSCode to see changes.

3. For ease of use, make sure to turn enable format-on-save on VSCode settings.

### Testing

1. Tests for the app can be run automatically with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

   or you can run it in watch mode which reruns the tests automatically when saving changes with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run test:dev
   ```

2. Locate app tests under the `tests` folder in the root directory. There are unit tests for three parts of the app: reusable frontend components, services that interface with the firebase backend, and utility functions used throughout the different modules of the app.

3. To start creating a new test, find an existing file module (auth, user, etc) or create a new file for a non-existant module to test for.

4. Write tests in accordance to the existing testing convention. Look into sibling files or tests within the same file module you are testing to see how you should be writing your tests.
